1. Parallelise model training
2. Figure out a scheme where you begin your first round by training a lot of models but on a small dataset?
3. Research more heuristics and bake them into the automation
4. Make each thread constantly look up and write to the variable containing the score of the best model
If the best model has a higher score than what's currently being trained, just forget about it and do another model
5. We can print contents of functions using
import inspect
lines = inspect.getsource(foo)
print(lines)
6. Fix inheritace structures
7. Add support for stacked models (how is that going to play out?)
8. Maybe create special printable functions that are print ready. Of course, don't forget to remove self.
